# pytubefix Video Downloader üé•‚¨áÔ∏è

This script downloads a YouTube video given the url and your choice of the video/audio by selecting the `itag`. I found it easiest to download both the best audio and video files separately and merge them in a movie maker (I used Clipchamp on Windows).

## To Run

Install the following dependencies:
- pytubefix

Inspect the `main.py` file and add your url. The comments in the file explain how to find which `itag` you would like. I debugged and ran this script in PyCharm.

## Background

I tried using the `pytube` library in July 2024 and was unsuccessful, but I was able to find this other library.
